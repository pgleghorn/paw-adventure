# paw-adventure

This is a text adventure I started writing as a kid back in 1992 when I was 17, I wrote it on the ZX Spectrum using Gilsoft's PAW.  It was mostly finished and submitted to Zenobi games for publishing, where it had a couple of rounds of playtesting and updates.  I think this is the first version I submitted to them.  Despite the kind and encouraging feedback I never finished it for publishing, maybe because of GCSE exams, or more probably the death of my dad in 1993.

This version was extracted from the only surviving cassette tape, using audacity and tzxtools, and remarkably there were no CRC errors. I used InPaws to capture the paw data from a .sna of the running game, from this paw data I can also generate fresh .tap files to load back into PAW. The b-side of the cassette has a modified version where I'd used a fastloader routine copied from a magazine, probably Your Sinclair.
